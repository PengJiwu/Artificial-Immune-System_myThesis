### Codes for Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA)
The MATLAB codes for my developed fault detection and isolation methodologies are provided here. 
The codes as well as a detailed description of the codes for the NSA and DCA algorithms are provided in their corresponding folders.

The title of my master thesis was [___Fault Detection and Isolation of Wind Turbines using Immune System Inspired Algorithms___](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/982044/) that is freely available on the Concordia University Repository.

The codes here are used in my thesis as well as the following peer-reviewed publications:

[___A Dendritic Cell Immune System Inspired Scheme for Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation of Wind Turbines___](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019842/)

[___A Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation Strategy by Using a Dendritic Cell Algorithm___](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7844400/)

[___A Negative Selection Immune System Inspired Methodology for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbines___](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7502133/)
